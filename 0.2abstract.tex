In this dissertation we will study the mathematical definition and practical use of some of the most well-known dimensional reduction techniques such as Principal Component Analysis (PCA) and Independent Component Analysis (ICA). 

We would then pre-process the acoustic signals of various Romance languages with techniques such as interpolation, and transform them into designated forms such as spectrum.

Finally, we would apply the dimensional reduction techniques on pre-processed data via R language, analyze and visualize the results.
